This project is a collaboration of all tasks given to the reader
in K&R: The C Programming Language (2nd ed). This project is aimed
as reference and open to anyone. No licensing will be used for
this project, nor it's programs.

A quick breakdown of the directory contents:
   The directory 'src' contains subdirectories of the sources of
   every task given in the book. CMake will build all the sources
   into binary files for your usage. I will create a core program
   which can direct you inside to all the tasks in the book, in
   plain view instead of accessing the binaries directly from
   your terminal. Further instructions will be given at a later
   date.
